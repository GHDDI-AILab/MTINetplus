# MTINet+
The study of molecule-target interaction  is quite important for drug discovery in terms of target identification, hit identification, pathway study, drug-drug interaction, etc. Most existing methodologies utilize either  biomedical network  information or molecule structural features to predict potential interaction link. However, the biomedical network information based methods  usually suffer from cold start problem, while structure based methods often give limited performance due to the structure/interaction assumption and data quality.  To address these issues, we propose a pseudo-siamese Graph Neural Network method, namely MTINet+, which learns both biomedical network topological  and molecule structural/chemical information  as  representations to predict potential interaction of given molecule and target pair. In MTINet+, 1-hop subgraphs of given molecule and target pair are extracted from known interaction of biomedical network as topological information, meanwhile the molecule structural and chemical  attributes are processed as molecule  information. MTINet+ learns these two types of information as embedding features for predicting the pair link.  In the experiments of different molecule-target interaction tasks, MTINet+ significantly outperforms over the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, in our designed  network sparsity experiments , MTINet+ shows strong robustness against different sparse biomedical networks.
